Hello there! I am Franz Marte, a highly-motivated entry-level web developer who is driven and passionate to find solutions to various problems in the ever-evolving world of tech.

With a background in adjudications as an  Immigration Services Officer I have fulfilled the mission and vision and goals of USCIS to administer the nation’s lawful immigration system by safeguarding its integrity to protect Americans and their homeland. I was also formerly a dedicated and experienced Hospital Corpsman, Surgical Technician, and Urology Technician who, through didactic and supervised practice, has acquired the knowledge and developed skills necessary for performing various procedures in the clinical, laboratory, and surgical setting.
